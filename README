This is ALPHA and considered VERY UNSTABLE!!!!

The project is to create a Deposit Module for Magento.

It overrides the custom price (as the deposit price) yet keeps the original price.

Tested on Magento 1.5.1.0 with the following product types:
virtual
configurable
simple

To Do:
Add backend properties
Allow admin to set when the rest of the money has come in

and any other suggestions!
